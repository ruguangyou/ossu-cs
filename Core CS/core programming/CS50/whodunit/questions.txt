1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library, which defines a set of typedefs that specify the exact width of an integer, and the "typedef" is used in macro.
2.  To specify exact width and signing.
3.  BYTE 8; DWORD 32; LONG 32; WORD 16
4.  0x4d42
5.  biSize is the size of BITINFOHEADER, i.e., 40 bytes. bfSize is the size of all bytes in the file.
6.  if biHeight is negative, the bitmap is top-down, with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  the reason that fopen might return NULL are: 1)the file does not exist; 2)no permissions to that file; 3)the file is being used by other program.
9.  the third argument in fread is the number of elements to be readed, in our code we only read the either BITMAPFILEHEADER or BITMAPINFOHEADER once.
10. 3
11. fseek moves the file pointer to a specific position.
12. current position of the file pointer.
